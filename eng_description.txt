I am a Python developer based on Fortaleza, Brazil. I have a foundation on web development, robotic process automation (RPA) and information security. Having began this journey in 2020 - the age of masks and being locked inside - I have went to great lengths to start my tech career, going through youtube videos and online courses like a hot knife through butter. I was working small freelance projects to local companies while also doing recruiting work to an international company in my area. I consider those days my own particular university, where I learned how to speak clearly, how to engage with clients, how to apply solutions and how to measure my time in a way that would yield real life results; and of course, the basic hard skills to get the job done.

I would like to think my communication skills are where I stand out particullarly well, both in writing and speaking, and both technical and interpersonally. This skill might not be such a selling point of a Software Developer, but it is something that smooths over team friction, provides a deeper understanding of client needs, allows for open discussion of relevant issues and feedback and also creates a basis for teamwork that is much more pleasant and less stressful. Smooth, clearheaded, satisfying work translate into good results!

I'm also big in the idea of "There is no better way to learn than to teach". This philosofy means that to teach somebody a technical aspect of my field is to cement my own knowledge while also challenging myself to completely understand something. When you see things in that manner, teaching becomes an opportunity to improve the lives of those around you while also doing the same for yourself. For that reason I always try to coach and tutor friends, family and colleagues that try to get into the field.

I don't know what else to say about myself...
